    problem solving:
     1.understand code
     2.debugging important**
     3.update code
     4.create a code
     
     common syntax in js
      datatypes,condition,operators,loops,functions.
      primitive:string,number,boolean,null,undefined(we cannot change them i.e muttable)
      non-primitive:arrays,objects (mutable) 
      operator+which performs operation bw 2 operands

      for-each is method

      functions:
      1.named 
      2.anonymous
      3.arrow
      4.IIFE (immediatly invoked function expression)

      functions are used for reusability
      return is used for 

     
        for proper structure give var name camel case ex:myName 
        if + is not given to prompt then it will store in string(it will concat) so use : +prompt
        console is only used to check output
        in real time we sould not use it because data is displayed in inspect (ex:passwords,user details)
        hoisting:
        only for fun declaration hoisting will be executed
        hoisting is not executed with arrow function
      
      arguments-original values
      parameters-copy of values passed as arguments

      loops:-
      for loop=if iteration is known
      while loop=based on condition 
      do while=atleast once it will execute (ex:netflix eps are give 1 or 2 for free then it will ask for subscription)
      for-in=based on index value
      for-of=based on values
